package Singleton;

/***
Explanation:

We use the getInstance() method to instantiate the singleton class 
and then when we again call with new key word it return the same instance 
which is created only once.

The single_instance is static. So it shared the shared the shared among 
all itâ€™s instances. That is why the object x, y and z having the same object.
Then we print the hashcode of all the object which is same which means 
they are sharing the same referrence and pointing 
to the same object.

		Singleton x = Singleton.getInstance();
		
		// Instantiating Singleton class with variable y
		Singleton y = Singleton.getInstance();
		
		// Instantiating Singleton class with variable z
		Singleton z = Singleton.getInstance();

        // declared
