Decorator: We wrapped objects to give them new responsibilities</br>

Singleton: Ensure that at class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it</br>


Design Principle:</br>
1. Program to an interface not an implementation.</br>
Program to interface really mean program to supertype.</br>
